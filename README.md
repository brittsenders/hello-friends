# hello-friends
I'm new here! Just learning how this platform works.

```python
def introduce_yourself():
    name = "Brittany"
    interests = ["Art", "AI", "Robotics"]
    about = "Greetings, I'm a tech enthusiast with a background in architecture. My mission is to infuse creativity into the world of coding and construct innovative digital masterpieces!"
    
    print(f"Hello, I'm Brittany!")
    print("Here's a bit about me:")
    print(about)
    
    print("\nMy Interests:")
    for interest in interests:
        print(f"- {interest}")
    
    print("\nLet's have a chat about AI, robotics, and the tech industry. Don't hesitate to connect for some engaging conversations in the digital realm!"

introduce_yourself()
